A state of the art Minecraft Anticheat meant for one job - to eliminate hackers.
If you would like to download, go to releases and download from there.

Commands:
/coreanticheat (alias /coreac) Main command.
/coreanticheat checks (player) This is to check flags.

Flag-backing (lagging the player back when flagging) has not yet been coded, but it will be soon.

This anticheat is free, but you can donate by DMing output#0001.
